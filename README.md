Building website from Cut-up  
Bird Brain junior developer application  

--------------------------------------------
  
New Technologies learnt:  
 - Sass  
 - Bourbon Neat  
 - CSS Shapes  
 - idangero.us Mobile Swiper + Pagination  

Gaining Experience with:  
 - Webpack  
 - Photoshop  
 - Illustrator  
 - HTML
 - CSS

Difficulties faced include:  
 - configuring webpack with sass and bourbon-neat  
 - react hot-loader with devMiddleware express server  
 
refactor into new branch removing react - keeping it simple with crux in mind.  
At the time of refactor the boilerplate was working with Sass and bourbon-neat. The main reason to move away from react was the constant compiling of sass to css using webpack that rendered designing a nightmare.  
  
Since then I have found sass --watch in the terminal and believe it would be much easier to work with react with this in mind. 

moving from installing sass with npm to ruby install
